# Dotfiles

This is only public so I can easily share it across machines. There is probably nothing of interest for you here ... or is there?

## Letting me own your machine

```
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/fortes/dotfiles/master/setup.sh)
```

If you're me (which you're not), then don't forget to set the remote url for this repo in order to push:

```
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:fortes/dotfiles.git
```
